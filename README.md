# Sparkify


## Table of Contents
1.  Installation
    The code in notebook Sparkify.ipynb is run on Python 3.6.x. Please install all the python dependencies using **requirements.txt**. Notebook is run on Spark in local mode. Hence all pyspark dependencies need to be installed for the code to execute without hiccups

2. Project Motivation
	Sparkify is an online music streaming service, like Spotify, where users can play music on demand or in a random mode, based on their subscription parameters. Data logs are collected on every action performed by every user and is compiled into structured json file. The goal of this project is to predict churn of a customer by engineering relevant features using the data provided. For this analysis, churn is defined as a user who is canceling his/her subscription. User downgrade is one of the potential ways to define churn, but this aspect is not explored in this analysis.
